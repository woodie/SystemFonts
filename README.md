# System Fonts

I have the new Nokia 3310 3G. The Nokia's System Fonts are nothing like those in the emulator, and there is no way to save anything to the filesystem on the devise. The goal of this project is to:
1. Render the System Fonts to an image on the device
2. Encode the font image as a PNG on the devise
3. Upload and the PNG image to the Internet
